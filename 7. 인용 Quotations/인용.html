        <p>The study is the first to project the long-term outlook for Antarctica's largest penguins,<br>
            which can grow 1.2 meters (four ft) tall, seeking to fill a gap in understanding climate <br>
            change and wildlife in one of the remotest parts of the planet.</p>

            Overall, numbers were set to fall by at least 19 percent from current levels by 2100 as sea <br>
            ice melts. And two-thirds of colonies of the birds, which have distinctive golden head <br>
            patches, would decline by more than half, it said.

        <p> <q>It's not happy news for the emperor penguin,</q> said Hal Castellan of the U.S. Woods Hole <br>
            Oceanographic Institution, a co-author of the study in the journal Nature Climate Change.
